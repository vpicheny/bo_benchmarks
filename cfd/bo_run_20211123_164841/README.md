In this run we fix the issue with prior variance introduced in the previous run, and as a result get a lot more evaluations that respect the constraint. Nevertheless, the model is still isn't perfect, as the model failed due to numerical stability on BO step 66.

Run uses safe settings in `run.sh`.
